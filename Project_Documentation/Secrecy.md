# Secrecy In The Project

---

Version 1.0.0

Often people will want to settle difficult questions by private communications &mdash; the Project Maintainers in particular can fall into this trap of discussing this among an &ldquo;inner circle&rdquo;. This is especially true in the early days of the Project, when there are so many important decisions to make, and, usually, few people qualified to make them. All the obvious disadvantages of public list discussions will loom palpably in front of you: the delay inherent in email conversations, the need to leave sufficient time for consensus to form, the hassle of dealing with naive newcomers who think they understand all the issues but actually don&rsquo;t (every project has these; sometimes they&rsquo;re next year&rsquo;s star contributors, sometimes they stay naive forever), the person who can&rsquo;t understand why we only want to solve problem X when it&rsquo;s obviously a subset of larger problem Y, and so on. The temptation to make decisions behind closed doors and present them as *faits accomplis*, or at least as the firm recommendations of a united and influential voting block, is be great indeed.

**Don&rsquo;t do it.**

As slow and cumbersome as public discussion can be, it&rsquo;s almost always preferable in the long run. Making important decisions in private is like spraying contributor repellent on the Project. No serious contributor will stick around for long in an environment where a secret council makes all the big decisions. Furthermore, public discussion has beneficial side effects that will last beyond whatever ephemeral technical question was at issue:

- The discussion will help train and educate new developers. You never know how many eyes are watching the conversation; even if most people don&rsquo;t participate, many may be lurking silently, gleaning information about the Project and the Project&rsquo;s products.
- The discussion will train you in the art of explaining technical issues to people who are not as familiar with the software as you are. This is a skill that requires practice, and you can&rsquo;t get that practice by talking to people who already know what you know.
- The discussion and its conclusions will be available in public archives forever after, enabling future discussions to avoid retracing the same steps.
- Finally, there is the possibility that someone on the list may make a real contribution to the conversation, by coming up with an idea you never anticipated. It&rsquo;s hard to say how likely this is; it just depends on the complexity of the issue and degree of specialisation required. But if anecdotal evidence may be permitted, this is more likely than you might intuitively expect. In the Subversion open source project, the founders believed they faced a deep and complex set of problems, which they had been thinking about hard for several months, and they frankly doubted that anyone on the newly created mailing list was likely to make a real contribution to the discussion. So they took the lazy route and started batting some technical ideas back and forth in private emails, until an observer of the project caught wind of what was happening and asked for the discussion to be moved to the public list. Rolling their eyes a bit, they did &mdash; and were stunned by the number of insightful comments and suggestions that quickly resulted. In many cases people offered ideas that had never even occurred to the founders. It turned out there were some very smart people on that list; they&rsquo;d just been waiting for the right bait. It&rsquo;s true that the ensuing discussions took longer than they would have if the founders had kept the conversation private, but they were so much more productive that it was well worth the extra time.

Without descending into hand-waving generalisations like &ldquo;the group is always smarter than the individual&rdquo; (we&rsquo;ve all met enough groups to know better), it must be acknowledged that there are certain activities at which groups excel. Massive peer review is one of them; generating large numbers of ideas quickly is another. The quality of the ideas depends on the quality of the thinking that went into them, of course, but you won&rsquo;t know what kinds of thinkers are out there until you stimulate them with a challenging problem.

Naturally, there are some discussions that must be had privately. But the guiding principle should always be: If there&rsquo;s no reason for it to be private, it should be public. Making this happen requires action. It&rsquo;s not enough merely to ensure that all your own posts go to the public list. You also have to nudge other people&rsquo;s unnecessarily private conversations to the list too. If someone tries to start a private discussion with you and there&rsquo;s no reason for it to be private, then it is incumbent on you to open the appropriate meta-discussion immediately. Don&rsquo;t even comment on the original topic until you&rsquo;ve either successfully steered the conversation to a public place, or ascertained that privacy really was needed. If you do this consistently, people will catch on pretty quickly and start to use the public forums by default.
