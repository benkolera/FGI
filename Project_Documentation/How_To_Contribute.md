# How To Contribute

---

Version 1.0.0

## WELCOME! And THANK YOU!

First of all, let us say both *&ldquo;Thank You!&rdquo;* and *&ldquo;Welcome!&rdquo;* Like most Collaborative Projects we&rsquo;re only as good as our Contributors and we rely on them &mdash; on *you* &mdash; to keep this Project alive and growing!

You&rsquo;re here (we hope) because you&rsquo;re excited about joining us in developing the better working versions of FG Rulesets, specifically designed for the Role Playing Games we play &mdash; or at the very least interested in finding out how you can help. So no-matter what your particular skill-set is or what interests you, we *have* got a place for you! And even if you feel as if you don&rsquo;t have any useful skills but want to help out anyway, then you can find a place here in the Project.

This *How To* document is simply the first in a series of related documents all explaining how you can contribute to the Project. No, you won&rsquo;t have to read them all, because different documents explain different parts of the Project so that different people can get the information they need to contribute to the parts of the Project they&rsquo;re interested in. We&rsquo;ve broken things up like this so that each piece of information is relevant, easily digestible, and focussed on the parts of the Project you&rsquo;re interested in.

The Project natural falls into a number of sub-Projects, and each sub-Project will naturally appeal to different people. The first sub-Project concerns the finalisation of the Project Documentation &mdash; everyone can contribute to this sub-Project, either in direct contributions, proof-reading, editing, or in other ways.

The second sub-Project is the development of the *Universal Die-Roller (UDR)* and the *Universal Die-Roller Foundry (UDRF)*. This sub-Project impacts all future Ruleset devevelopment, because having a good, solid, working die-rolling system is fundemental to practically *all* RPGs and therefore Rulesets.

The third sub-Project will be the further development of the *Deadlands Classic* and *Deadlands Hell On Earth Classic* Rulesets, followed by other Rulesets and enhancements to the existing *DORCore* Ruleset.

In addition to all of the above are any extra &ldquo;features&rdquo; that Contributors would like to see in a Ruleset, or in *all* Rulesets, plus any refinement and further development of the Project&rsquo; documentation..

All of this is laid out in the Project&rsquo;s [Roadmap](Project_Roadmap.md).

All of the Project Documentation is listed below in logical groupings, so read the ones you need to (and the others that you want to) and find out how to effectively contribute to the Project.

If you have any further questions or require any further help, please see the Project&rsquo;s [FAQs](FAQs.md) Document, or don&rsquo;t hesitate to email the Project on <fgi@freelists.org>.
