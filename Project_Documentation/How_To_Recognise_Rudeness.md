# How To Recognise Rudeness

---

Version 1.0.0

One of the defining characteristics of open source culture is its distinctive notions of what does and does not constitute rudeness. While the conventions described below are not unique to free software and free document development, nor even to software in general — they would be familiar to anyone working in mathematics, the hard sciences, or engineering disciplines — free software and free documents, with their porous boundaries and constant influx of newcomers, are environments where these conventions are especially likely to be encountered by people unfamiliar with them.

Let&rsquo;s start with the things that are *not* rude:

Technical criticism, even when direct and unpadded, is not rude. Indeed, it can be a form of flattery: the critic is saying, by implication, that the target is worth taking seriously, and is worth spending some time on. That is, the more viable it would have been to simply ignore someone&rsquo;s post, the more of a compliment it becomes to take the time to criticise it (unless the critique descends into an *ad hominem* attack or some other form of obvious rudeness, of course).

Blunt, unadorned questions are not rude either. Questions that in other contexts might seem cold, rhetorical, or even mocking, are often intended seriously, and have no hidden agenda other than eliciting information as quickly as possible. The famous technical support question &ldquo;Is your computer plugged in?&rdquo; is a classic example of this. The support person really does need to know if your computer is plugged in, and after the first few days on the job, has gotten tired of prefixing their question with polite blandishments (&ldquo;I beg your pardon, I just want to ask a few simple questions to rule out some possibilities. Some of these might seem pretty basic, but bear with me&hellip;&rdquo;). At this point, they don&rsquo;t bother with the padding any more, they just ask straight out: is it plugged in or not? Equivalent questions are asked all the time on free software mailing lists. The intent is not to insult the recipient, but to quickly rule out the most obvious (and perhaps most common) explanations. Recipients who understand this and react accordingly win points for taking a broad-minded view without prompting. But recipients who react badly must not be reprimanded, either. It&rsquo;s just a collision of cultures, not anyone&rsquo;s fault. Explain amiably that your question (or criticism) had no hidden meanings; it was just meant to get (or transmit) information as efficiently as possible, nothing more.

So what *is* rude?

By the same principle under which detailed technical criticism is a form of flattery, failure to provide quality criticism can be a kind of insult. We don&rsquo;t mean simply ignoring someone&rsquo;s work, be it a proposal, code change, new ticket filing, or whatever. Unless you explicitly promised a detailed reaction in advance, it&rsquo;s usually okay to simply not react at all. People will assume you just didn&rsquo;t have time to say anything. But if you do react, don&rsquo;t skimp: take the time to really analyse things, provide concrete examples where appropriate, dig around in the archives to find related posts from the past, etc. Or if you don&rsquo;t have time to put in that kind of effort, but still need to write some sort of brief response, then state the shortcoming openly in your message (&ldquo;I think there&rsquo;s a ticket filed for this, but unfortunately didn&rsquo;t have time to search for it, sorry&rdquo;). The main thing is to recognise the existence of the cultural norm, either by fulfilling it or by openly acknowledging that one has fallen short this time. Either way, the norm is strengthened. But failing to meet that norm, while at the same time not explaining why you failed to meet it, is like saying the topic (and those participating in it) was not worth much of your time — that your time is more valuable than theirs. Better to show that your time is valuable by being terse than by being lazy.


There are many other forms of rudeness, of course, but most of them are not specific to free software and document development, and common sense is a good enough guide to avoid them.
