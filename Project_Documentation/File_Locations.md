# File Locations

Version 1.0.0

The Project is broken up into a number of folders to help both us and you locate the relevant information quickly and efficiently.

- If you&rsquo;re looking for the information about the Project itself you&rsquo;ll find it in the [**Project_Documentation**](https://github.com/Dulux-Oz/FGI/tree/tree/master/Project_Documentation) folder.
- The [**Support_Files**](https://github.com/Dulux-Oz/FGI/Support_Files) folder contains templates, images, design documents, coding notes, and other miscellaneous files use by the Project that probably won&rsquo;t be of interest to anyone but our die-hard fans.
- The [**DORCoreMin**](https://github.com/Dulux-Oz/FGI/DORCoreMin) folder contains the actual code and resource files for the FGI. It is the one that is used to create the (cut down development version) of the DORCore Ruleset.
	+ The UDR Folder is currently the main folder for the UDR Code (the Project&rsquo;s current focus). Most, if not all, work should be done here.
	+ The Core Folder contains code and resources used to get the DORCoreMinimal Ruleset working. This should almost always remain untouched.
	+ The DORBase Folder contains code and resources used to get the DORCoreMinimal Ruleset working. This should almost always remain untouched.

The Project Documentation Folder (*Project_Documentation*) and the Support Files Folder (*Support_Files*) contain all the relevant information on the Project&rsquo;s *Coding Standards*, *Naming Conventions*, *Document Formats and Layouts*, *Data Models*, *Governance*, *How To&rsquo;s*, *Templates*, *Links to External Sources of Information*, etc, plus information and links on how to use *GitKracken* (the Project&rsquo;s preferred Git-Client) and *GK-Boards* (the Project&rsquo;s preferred Issue Tracker, etc), both in and of themselves, and also with *GitHub* (the Project&rsquo;s &ldquo;in-the-cloud&rdquo; Git-Server). Also included in the Project Documentation is the [*FGI-Workflow Model*](https://github.com/Dulux-Oz/FGI/tree/tree/master/Project_Documentation/How_To_Participate_In_The_Project_Workflow.md) and how to set everything up to work with it. The *FGI-Workflow Model* is how the Project actually runs, how to include you work within the Project, and how releases from the Project are performed.

**Note:** *GitKracken*, *GK-Boards*, and *GitHub* are all ***free*** &mdash; although there are &ldquo;Pro&rdquo; versions you can pay for if you like; this is not necessary for this Project.

*GitKracken* and *GK-Boards* integrate fully with *GitHub* (including GitHub&rsquo;s *Issue Tracker*, etc). While the use of *GitKracken* and *GK-Boards* is *highly* recommended, any Git-Client Tracker can be used with this Project &mdash; provided that the *FGI-Workflow* is followed &mdash; although you will be missing out on a lot of the features provided by *GitKracken* and *GK-Boards*.
