# Voting

---

Version 1.0.0

At various times during the Project it will be necessary for the Project to &ldquo;take a vote&rdquo;. Voting should be and is expected to be a relatively rare event, as most Project decisions will be made either by Consensus or by the BD, depending upon which model of Project Governance the Project is currently operating under.

## When We Vote

Typical times when a vote will be necessary are: 

- During a pre-Release, when our Release Manager is taking submissions for what features and bug fixes should be included in the Release.
- When Consensus Cannot Be Reached
- Appointing a Maintainer
- Removing a Maintainer

## How We Vote

Voting is simple: using the mailing list one of the Maintainers will call a vote. In a reply mail simply indicate your vote by writing &ldquo;+1&rdquo; followed by your name; or &ldquo;-1&rdquo; (effectively a veto) with a reason, followed by your name; or if you are not eligible to vote but want to show your support you can write &ldquo;+0&rdquo;.

Each person can only caste one vote for any given proposal.

Unless otherwise specified elsewhere in the Project Documentation, a vote is successful if it totals &ldquo;+3&rdquo; or more and receives no vetoes (no &ldquo;-1&rdquo;).

### Vetoes

The FGI Project allow a special kind of vote known as a veto. A veto is a way for a Project Maintainer to put a halt to a hasty or ill-considered change, at least long enough for everyone to discuss it more. Think of a veto as somewhere between a very strong objection and a filibuster. Any veto should be accompanied by a thorough explanation; a veto without such an explanation should be considered invalid on arrival.

With vetoes comes the problem of veto abuse. Sometimes Maintainers are too eager to raise the stakes of disagreement by casting a veto, when really all that was called for was more discussion. You can prevent veto abuse by being very reluctant to use vetoes yourself, and by gently calling it out when someone else uses their veto too often. If necessary, you can also remind the group that vetoes are binding for only as long as the group agrees they are â€” after all, if a clear majority of Maintainers (or Project Contributors) wants X, then X is going to happen one way or another. Either the vetoing Maintainer will back down, or the group will overturn the veto (as explained below).

Like votes, vetoes can apply retroactively. It&rsquo;s not okay to object to a veto on the grounds that the change in question has already been committed, or the action taken (unless it&rsquo;s something irrevocable, like putting out a press release). On the other hand, a veto that arrives weeks or months late isn&rsquo;t likely to be taken very seriously, nor should it be.

Unless specified elsewhere, a veto on a vote can be over-turned by a 2/3 majority of those eligible to vote. A &ldquo;veto overturn&rdquo; vote is a new vote where a &ldquo;-1&rdquo; does not indicate a &ldquo;veto&rdquo; but instead is used to indicate support for the existing veto.

### In Summary

|When You Want To|Write|
|:--|:-:|
|Vote in Favour|+1|
|Vote in Favour (when not eligible)|+0|
|Veto the Vote|-1 (with a reason)|
|Support an existing Veto (in a &ldquo;veto overturn&rdquo;)|-1|

And remember to include your name as well.

## Who Gets To Vote

The Project Maintainers, having shown themselves to be fair and able to operate in the best interests of the Project, are the members of the Project who are eligible to vote (but see *Polls Vs Votes* below).

However, because our Project uses a two-tier system for its Project Maintainers a question naturally arise: what can the Partial Maintainers vote on?

The answer is simple: a Partial Maintainer can vote on matters confined exclusively to that Maintainer&rsquo;s domain, and not on anything else. Importantly, our project does have a mechanism for casting advisory votes (essentially, the Partial Maintainer writes &ldquo;+0&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;+1&rdquo; on the ballot). There&rsquo;s no reason to silence people just because their vote isn&rsquo;t formally binding.

Full Maintainers can vote on anything, just as they can commit anywhere in the Project, and only Full Maintainers vote on adding new Maintainers of any kind. In practice, though, the ability to add new Partial Maintainers is usually delegated: any Full Maintainer can &ldquo;sponsor&rdquo; a new Partial Maintainer, and Partial Maintainers in a domain can often essentially choose new Maintainers for that same domain.

### In Summery

Each Maintainer is be able to vote on matters that fall within the scope of their commit access, and not on matters outside that, and votes on procedural questions default to the Full Maintainers, unless there&rsquo;s some reason (as decided by the Full Maintainers) to widen the electorate. Remember that voting should be rare anyway, except for technical votes such as the change voting described elsewhere in the Project Documentation.

## Polls Vs Votes

Polls are different to Votes in a number of important aspects. First of all, Polls are non-binding. While the Project Leadership will certainly take the results of a Poll into account, they are not obliged to do so. Polls are typically called by one of the Project&rsquo;s Maintainers (Full or Partial) in an effort to obtain the views of all of the Project&rsquo;s Contributors (and also the views of others).

Everyone can participate in a Poll. To do so simply follow the process outlined above under Voting, but vetoes do not apply: a &ldquo;-1&rdquo; simply indicates &ldquo;non-support&rdquo; for the Poll&rsquo;s proposal.

Polls can have more than one proposal, and a key aspect of Polls is that extra proposals can be submitted by anyone, simply by including them on the ballot email.

People can also indicate their support for more than one option in a Poll by adding a &ldquo;+1&rdquo; to each desired proposal. However, &ldquo;polling&rdquo; for the same proposal more than once (adding &ldquo;+1&rdquo; to a given proposal more than once) is discouraged and is actually considered &ldquo;cheating&rdquo; by some &mdash; please don&rsquo;t do this!
