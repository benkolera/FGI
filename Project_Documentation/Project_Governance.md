# Project Governance

---

Version 1.0.0

This document is all about how we run the Project: who&rsquo;s in charge, how things are decided, and how things are done.

If you have any further questions or require any further help, please see the Project&rsquo;s [FAQs](FAQs.md) Document, or don&rsquo;t hesitate to email the Project on <fgi@freelists.org>.

## Current Governance Framework

At the moment the Project runs under a [&ldquo;Benevolent Dictator&rdquo; Model](BD_Model.md), in the same way that most RPG groups have their GM acting as a &ldquo;Benevolent Dictator&rdquo;.

Our &ldquo;Benevolent Dictator&rdquo; (BD) at the moment is our Project Founder.

## Planned Governance Framework

Of course, as our Project grows and matures we expect eventually to move to a [&ldquo;Consensus-Based Democracy&rdquo; Model](CBD_Model.md) of Project Governance.

Under the &ldquo;Consensus-Based Democracy&rdquo; Model of project governance there will come a time when a consensus cannot be reached. The fall-back position in such a case is to have a [vote](Voting.md).

## &ldquo;Project Officers&rdquo;

A Project such as ours requires a few different &ldquo;Project Officers&rdquo;; individuals who perform specific, sensitive jobs for the Project to help it run smoothly and achieve the Projects [goals](Mission_Statement.md).

Our Project has the following &ldquo;Project Officers&rdquo;:

- Release Manager

- Issues Manager

- [Project Maintainers](Maintainers.md)
