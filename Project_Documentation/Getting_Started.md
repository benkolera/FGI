## 1. Read The Relevant Project Documentation

These are the relevant Project Documents to read (if you haven't done so already), in the correct order that they should be read in. Reading these Documents will give you the knowledge you need to &ldquo;hit the ground&rdquo; with you participation in the Project.

**Note:** Some of these Documents you will have probably already read, while some of them you may not need to read because you already have the relevantr knowledge (skim these anyway, just to be complete). These documents are listed here for completeness, and also as a further reference.

## 3. Set Up A Gravatar

**Optional**

Both GitKracken and GitHub can use a *Gravatar* (Globally Recognise Avatar). A Gravatar is a User Profile which is accessible over the Internet. While a Gravatar is not required to Contribute to the Project, it is highly recommended.

You can set up a Gravatar on the Gravatar Website [gravatar.com](https://gravatar.com).

In GitKraken&rsquo;s `Preferences`, under `Profiles` you may like to modify your profile details, including your GitKraken Avatar. If you&rsquo;d like to use a custom Avatar, then both GitKraken and GitHub can both use a *Gravatar*.

## 4. Create A GitHub Account

If you don&rsquo;t already have a GitHub Account you will need to create one. Go to [github.org](https://github.org) and sign up for a free account.

## 5. Fork The Project&rsquo;s Repository

<<<<<<< HEAD
See [How To Fork The Project](https://github.com/Dulux-Oz/FGI/tree/master/Project_Documentation/How_To_Fork_The_Project.md).

## 6. Download And Install GitKraken

Create a suitable working folder on your computer (eg `c:/FGI_Project`).

Download GitKraken &mdash; [www.gitkraken.com/download](https://www.gitkraken.com/invite/dDzS6Skp).

Run the installer.

Launch GitKraken (***Unleash the KRAKEN!***).

That&rsquo;s it &mdash; no other Git tools are required for GitKraken, so once you&rsquo;ve run the installer, you can open the program and get going.

GitKraken works directly with your repositories with no dependencies &mdash; you don&rsquo;t even need to have Git installed on your system.

**Note:** *GitKracken*, *GK-Boards*, and *GitHub* are all ***free*** &mdash; although there are &ldquo;Pro&rdquo; versions you can pay for if you like; this is not necessary for this Project.

## 7. Connect GitKraken To GitHub

Open up GitKracken on your computer.

In the top right-hand corner of the GitKraken window, click on the `Settings` Menu-Button and choose `Preferences`.

![GitKraken Settings Menu](https://support.gitkraken.com/img/documentation/integrations/github/preferences.png)

From the Authentication window, select GitHub.com and then hit the green `Connect to GitHub` button.

![GitKraken GitHub Connect](https://support.gitkraken.com/img/documentation/integrations/github/preferences-authentication.png)

Enter in your GitHub Username and Password.

Click on the green `Generate SSH key and add to GitHub` Button.

![GitKracken Generate SHH](https://support.gitkraken.com/img/documentation/integrations/github/generate-ssh.png)

*GitKracken* and *GK-Boards* integrate fully with *GitHub* (including GitHub&rsquo;s *Issue Tracker*, etc). While the use of *GitKracken* and *GK-Boards* is *highly* recommended, any Git-Client can be used with this Project &mdash; provided that the *FGI-Workflow* is followed &mdash; although you will be missing out on a lot of the features provided by *GitKracken* and *GK-Boards*.
