# Getting Started

---

Version 1.0.0

To fully participate in the FGI Project you need to set up your working copy of the Git repository and the tools necessary to work with the Project. This is all outlined and explained below.

If you have any further questions or require any further help, please see the Project&rsquo;s [FAQs](https://github.com/Dulux-Oz/FGI/tree/master/Project_Documentation/FAQs.md) Document, or don&rsquo;t hesitate to email the Project on <fgi@freelists.org>.

## 1. Read The Relevant Project Documentation

These are the relevant Project Documents to read (if you haven't done so already), in the correct order that they should be read in. Reading these Documents will give you the knowledge you need to &ldquo;hit the ground&rdquo; with you participation in the Project.

**Note:** Some of these Documents you will have probably already read, while some of them you may not need to read because you already have the relevantr knowledge (skim these anyway, just to be complete). These documents are listed here for completeness, and also as a further reference.

## 2. Watch The GitKracken Tutorial Videos

If you&rsquo;ve never used GitKracken, GK-Boards, or Git before, or you need a refresher then tak a moment or two to watch the [Videos Tutorials](https://github.com/Dulux-Oz/FGI/tree/master/Project_Documents/Video_Tutorials.md) in the order presented.

## 3. Set Up A Gravatar

**Optional**

Both GitKracken and GitHub can use a *Gravatar* (Globally Recognise Avatar). A Gravatar is a User Profile which is accessible over the Internet. While a Gravatar is not required to Contribute to the Project, it is highly recommended.

You can set up a Gravatar on the Gravatar Website [gravatar.com](https://gravatar.com).

In GitKraken&rsquo;s `Preferences`, under `Profiles` you may like to modify your profile details, including your GitKraken Avatar. If you&rsquo;d like to use a custom Avatar, then both GitKraken and GitHub can both use a *Gravatar*.

## 4. Create A GitHub Account

If you don&rsquo;t already have a GitHub Account you will need to create one. Go to [github.org](https://github.org) and sign up for a free account.

## 5. Fork The Project&rsquo;s Repository

See [How To Fork The Project](https://github.com/Dulux-Oz/FGI/tree/master/Project_Documentation/How_To_Fork_The_Project.md).

## 6. Download And Install GitKraken

Create a suitable working folder on your computer (eg `c:/FGI_Project`).

Download GitKraken &mdash; [www.gitkraken.com/download](https://www.gitkraken.com/invite/dDzS6Skp).

Run the installer.

Launch GitKraken (***Unleash the KRAKEN!***).

That&rsquo;s it &mdash; no other Git tools are required for GitKraken, so once you&rsquo;ve run the installer, you can open the program and get going.

GitKraken works directly with your repositories with no dependencies &mdash; you don&rsquo;t even need to have Git installed on your system.

**Note:** *GitKracken*, *GK-Boards*, and *GitHub* are all ***free*** &mdash; although there are &ldquo;Pro&rdquo; versions you can pay for if you like; this is not necessary for this Project.

## 7. Connect GitKraken To GitHub

Open up GitKracken on your computer.

In the top right-hand corner of the GitKraken window, click on the `Settings` Menu-Button and choose `Preferences`.

![GitKraken Settings Menu](https://support.gitkraken.com/img/documentation/integrations/github/preferences.png)

From the Authentication window, select GitHub.com and then hit the green `Connect to GitHub` button.

![GitKraken GitHub Connect](https://support.gitkraken.com/img/documentation/integrations/github/preferences-authentication.png)

Enter in your GitHub Username and Password.

Click on the green `Generate SSH key and add to GitHub` Button.

![GitKracken Generate SHH](https://support.gitkraken.com/img/documentation/integrations/github/generate-ssh.png)

*GitKracken* and *GK-Boards* integrate fully with *GitHub* (including GitHub&rsquo;s *Issue Tracker*, etc). While the use of *GitKracken* and *GK-Boards* is *highly* recommended, any Git-Client can be used with this Project &mdash; provided that the *FGI-Workflow* is followed &mdash; although you will be missing out on a lot of the features provided by *GitKracken* and *GK-Boards*.

## 8. Set Your GitKraken Preferences

**Optional**

[Here](https://github.com/Dulux-Oz/FGI/tree/master/Project_Documents/GitKracken_Preferences.md) is a list of Project Recommended GitKracken Preferences which, as the name says, the Project recommends all Contributors use. These preferences and settings are not required to Contribute to the Project, but they are highly recommended.

## 9. Clone Your Public Server-Side Repository

In the top left-hand corner of GitKracken, click the `Exit Preferences` Button.

See [How To Clone A Repository](https://github.com/Dulux-Oz/FGI/tree/master/Project_Documentation/How_To_Clone_A_Repository.md)

## 10. Develop Your Git Knowledge

**Optional**

Read any further Project Documents and watch any further Tutorial Videos to *really* get a handle on how to use Git, GitHub, Gitkracken, and GK-Boards.

## 12. Get To Work

Start working by following the Project&rsquo;s [*FGI-Workflow*](https://github.com/Dulux-Oz/FGI/tree/master/Project_Documentation/How_To_Participate_In_The_Project_Workflow.md) and become one of our valuable Contributors.
