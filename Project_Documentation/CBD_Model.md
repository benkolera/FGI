# Consensus-Based Democracy Model

---

Version 1.0.0

As projects get older, they tend to move away from the Benevolent Dictatorship (BD) model and toward more openly democratic systems. This is not necessarily out of dissatisfaction with a particular Benevolent Dictator. It&rsquo;s simply that group-based governance is more &ldquo;evolutionarily stable&rdquo;, to borrow a biological metaphor. Whenever a Benevolent Dictator steps down, or attempts to spread decision-making responsibility more evenly, it is an opportunity for the group to settle on a new, non-dictatorial system &mdash; establish a constitution, as it were. The group may not take this opportunity the first time, or the second, but eventually they will; once they do, the decision is unlikely ever to be reversed. Common sense explains why: If a group of N people were to vest one person with special power, it would mean that N-1 people were each agreeing to decrease their individual influence. People usually don&rsquo;t want to do that. Even if they did, the resulting dictatorship would still be conditional: the group anointed the BD, clearly the group could depose the BD. Therefore, once a project has moved from leadership by a charismatic individual to a more formal, group-based system, it rarely moves back.

The details of how these systems work vary widely, but there are two common elements: one, the group works by consensus most of the time; two, there is a formal voting mechanism to fall back on when consensus cannot be reached.

Consensus simply means an agreement that everyone is willing to live with. It is not an ambiguous state: a group has reached consensus on a given question when someone proposes that consensus has been reached and no one contradicts the assertion. The person proposing consensus should, of course, state specifically what the consensus is, and what actions would be taken in consequence of it, if those are not obvious.

Most conversation in a project is on technical topics, such as the right way to fix a certain bug, whether or not to add a feature, how strictly to document interfaces, etc. Consensus-based governance works well because it blends seamlessly with the technical discussion itself. By the end of a discussion, there is often general agreement on what course to take. Someone will usually make a concluding post, which is simultaneously a summary of what has been decided and an implicit proposal of consensus. This provides a last chance for someone else to say &ldquo;Wait, I didn&rsquo;t agree to that. We need to hash this out some more.&rdquo;

For small, uncontroversial decisions, the proposal of consensus is implicit. For example, when a Contributor spontaneously commits a bugfix, the commit itself is a proposal of consensus: &ldquo;I assume we all agree that this bug needs to be fixed, and that this is the way to fix it.&rdquo; Of course, the Contributor does not actually say that; they just commits the fix, and the others in the project do not bother to state their agreement, because silence is consent. If someone commits a change that turns out not to have consensus, the result is simply for the project to discuss the change as though it had not already been committed. The reason this is because with a version control system in place (such as GitKracken and BitBucket) changes can be reversed, if necessary.
