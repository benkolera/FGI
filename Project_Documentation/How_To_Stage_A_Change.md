## Staging Files

Before you commit changes, you will need to stage your files. This adds selected file contents to the index, in a way flagging your work as good to go.

To start, select the `//WIP` node to see all your files on the right panel (or towards the bottom depending on your window size).

As you select and hover the files, a green button labeled `Stage File` 
will appear demanding attention. You may of course decide whether or not you will stage each file.

You may alternatively choose to `Stage all changes` or click on any files you wish to review in the difference engine *diff*.

## Unstaging

Conversely, you may unstage a file by selecting a staged file and hitting the red `Unstage` button that appears. If you click on a file to view the diff, you can selectively unstage lines or hunks.

If you need to unstage all your files, we then use the red `Unstage all changes` button just above the `Staged Files` section. From here you should be set to [commit!](How_To_Commit_A_Change.md)
