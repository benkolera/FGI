Version 1.0.0

Saving you work with Gitkraken is done with *commits*.

## Making A Commit

To make a commit in GitKraken, select your Work in Progress (// WIP) and you will see all your recent changes on the right panel.

![GitKraken WIP](https://support.gitkraken.com/img/documentation/working-with-files/commits/WIP-stage.png)

Select the files you wish to [stage](How_To_Stage_A_Change.md), and click on any files you wish to review.

When youâ€™re ready, type your Commit Message (following the [Commit Message Template](../Support_Files/Commit_Message_Template.md)) and hit the green `Commit` button to commit your changes.

The graph will update with your commit.

The equivalent Git CLI Commands are:

~~~
git checkout -b some-feature
# Edit some code
git commit -a -m "Add first draft of some feature";
~~~
