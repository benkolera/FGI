# How To Test Your Code Changes

---

Version 1.0.0

Testing any code changes is easy. Just follow the steps below.

If you have any further questions or require any further help, please see the Project&rsquo;s [FAQs](FAQs.md) Document, or don&rsquo;t hesitate to email the Project on <fgi@freelists.org>.

## 1. Locate the FG Rulesets Folder/Directory

The easiest way to do this is to click on the `Open data folder` Button, located towards the top-right of the FG Launcher.

## 2. Copy The Working Copy Of The `DORCorMin` Folder/Directory To The FG Rulesets Folder/Directory

Copy the `DORCorMin` Folder/Directory (or whichever Ruleset you are working on) itself (not its contents). There is no need to zip the folder into a `PAK` File, FG will work perfectly AOK with the Folder/Directory.

## 3. Create A New Campaign Using The `DORCoreMin` Ruleset

If you haven't already done so, create a new Campaign on the FG Launcher.

Note that if are using the Free version of FG, Created Campaigns are removed when FG is shut down, so you will have to repeat this step every time you want to teat.

## 4. Start The Campaign &amp; Perform The Actions Required To See If Your New Code Works

Take not of any error meesages that come up: these will help you to fix any bugs.

## That&rsquo;s It

Repeat the process until everything is working properly.
