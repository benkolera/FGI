# How To Create A Branch

---

Version 1.0.0

The best (but not the only) way to create a branch for a new feature, release, or hotfix is to use the `GitFlow` section of the GitKraken&rsquo;s left panel.

You can create new branches by clicking the green button on the GitFlow menu on the left. Or whenever you add a branch, if you include the prefix for the branch type, GitKraken will recognise it as being a GitFlow branch and therefore the Project&rsquo;s FGI-Workflow branch, i.e. `feature/branch-name`. Any branches that do not have the prefix, will be displayed in the local repository section, but not in the GitFlow menu.
