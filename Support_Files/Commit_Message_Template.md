This is a sample commit message which can be used as an example/template for how to write commit messages in GitKraken.
As can be seen, it contains a Header and a Body/Description.
The Header contains the Date of the Commit, your Initials/Signature, and a Brief Description of what the Commit is all about, in the Project-Approved format.
The Body/Description contains a more detailed Description of what the Commit contains, etc, followed by the Project's DCO (see the DCO.md and DCO_Explained.md Documents in the Project_Document Folder) in the Project-Approved format.
