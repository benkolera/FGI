# The Project&rsquo;s Covenant Code Of Conduct

---

Version 1.0.0

## Our Pledge

We as Members, Contributors, and Maintainers pledge to make participation in our Project and its Community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy Project and Community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behaviour that contributes to a positive environment for our Project and Community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people.
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
- Accepting responsibility and apologising to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience.
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community.

Examples of unacceptable behaviour include:

- The use of sexualised language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind.
- Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others&rsquo; private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission.
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project Maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behaviour and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behaviour that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Project Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, documentation edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code Of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code Of Conduct applies within all Project and Community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the Project and/or Community in public spaces. Examples of representing our Project and Community include using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or off-line event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour may be reported to the Project Maintainers at <fgi-maintainers@freelists.org>, which is a shared in-box. If the incident involves one of the Project Maintainers, you can contact either the Project Founder at <matthew@peregrineit.net> or [an as yet to be determined individual] at [someone@somewhere.com]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All Project Maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Project Maintainers will follow these Project And Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code Of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact:** Use of inappropriate language or other behaviour deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the Project and the Community.

**Consequence:** A private, written warning from Project Maintainers, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behaviour was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact:** A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence:** A warning with consequences for continued behaviour. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code Of Conduct, for a specified period of time (typically 7 days). This includes avoiding interactions in Project and Community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact:** A serious violation of the Project&rsquo;s and the Community&rsquo's standards, including sustained inappropriate behaviour.

**Consequence:** A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the Project and/or Community for a specified period of time (typically 7 days). No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code Of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact:** Demonstrating a pattern of violation of Project&rsquo;s and the Community&rsquo's standards, including sustained inappropriate behaviour,  harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence:** A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the Project and the Community.
